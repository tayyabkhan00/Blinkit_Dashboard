Blinkit Power BI Dashboard Project 
Project Statement 
Context: 
Blinkit, a quick-commerce platform, enables users to order groceries and essentials for 
delivery in minutes. For businesses operating at this scale, effective data management and 
visualization are crucial for monitoring performance, identifying trends, and optimizing 
operations. 
Challenge: 
Managing and analyzing a large volume of data related to orders, inventory, delivery times, 
customer feedback, and operational metrics can be overwhelming. Without a centralized 
dashboard, decision-making becomes inefficient, impacting overall performance and 
customer satisfaction. 
Goals: 
1. Develop a comprehensive dashboard to consolidate and visualize key performance 
indicators (KPIs) such as: 
o Number of daily/weekly/monthly orders. 
o Delivery time trends and bottlenecks. 
o Inventory status and restocking requirements. 
o Customer satisfaction ratings and feedback analysis. 
o Revenue and profit margins. 
2. Enable real-time updates and dynamic filtering for interactive data exploration. 
3. Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer 
experience. 
Target Audience: 
• Business stakeholders looking for high-level summaries of performance. 
• Operations managers requiring granular data for process optimization. 
• Data analysts and engineers exploring the backend data for advanced insights. 
Key Features: 
1. Intuitive charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts) for quick 
understanding. 
2. Drill-down capabilities for detailed data exploration. 
3. Filters to segment data by time periods, regions, or product categories. 
4. Export options to share reports with team members. 
Expected Outcomes: 
• A user-friendly dashboard that empowers stakeholders to make data-driven 
decisions. 
• Increased operational efficiency through enhanced data visibility. 
• A template or framework that can be adapted to similar quick-commerce 
businesses.
